# Mars-Data-HTML-Scraping

The following analysis is separated into two deliverables:

Deliverable 1 uses automated browsing from Splinter to visit the Mars News website, scrapes the article title and body-preview elements using BeautifulSoup, and stores the results in a Python list of dictionaries.

Deliverable 2 uses automated browsing from Splinter to visit the Mars Temperature Data website, scapes the table, stores data in a Pandas DataFrame, analyzes the data through Pandas methods and data visualization, and finally saving the DataFrame by exporting it as a csv file.
